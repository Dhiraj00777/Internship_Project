# Internship_Project_AI_Varient

In this project, we will use the "World_development_measurement.xlsx" dataset to explore the development indicators of different countries and identify patterns and clusters based on their similarities.

The dataset contains data on various development indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), life expectancy, literacy rate, and infant mortality rate, for more than 200 countries over a period of several years. The data is organized in rows, where each row corresponds to a country and each column corresponds to a development indicator.

Our goal in this project is to perform clustering on the dataset to identify groups of countries that have similar development profiles. We will use a variety of clustering methods such as k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN, and evaluate their performance using metrics such as silhouette score, cluster purity, and cluster homogeneity.

To prepare the data for clustering, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and identify any missing or outlier values. We will also perform feature engineering to select the most relevant features for clustering and reduce the dimensionality of the data using techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA).

Once we have identified the clusters, we will perform a detailed analysis of each cluster to understand the characteristics of the countries in each group and identify any trends or patterns that emerge. We will also use the clusters for supervised learning by training classification models on the labeled data and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Finally, we will deploy the clustering and classification models using a web application framework such as Flask or Streamlit to create an interactive interface for exploring the development indicators of different countries and predicting their cluster labels based on their features.

Overall, this project will provide a valuable opportunity to apply a range of data science techniques such as EDA, clustering, supervised learning, and web application development to a real-world dataset and gain insights into the development patterns of different countries.
